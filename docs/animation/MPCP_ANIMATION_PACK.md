# 1. Narration Script (≈60–90 seconds)

## Scene 1 — The Problem
Visual:
Robots, vehicles, EV chargers, and AI agents attempting to pay for services.

Narration:
"Machines are starting to transact in the real world — paying for parking, charging, tolls, and services."

"Today these payments rely on proprietary APIs and centralized systems. There is no standard way to authorize machine payments, verify them, or resolve disputes."

---

## Scene 2 — Existing Agent Protocols
Visual:
Nodes labeled MCP, A2A, ACP connected with arrows.

Narration:
"New protocols help agents talk to tools and to each other…"

"But they do not solve how machines safely authorize and verify payments."

---

## Scene 3 — Introducing MPCP
Visual stack:

PolicyGrant
↓
BudgetAuthorization
↓
PaymentAuthorization
↓
Settlement

Narration:
"MPCP introduces a simple chain of authorization for machine payments."

"Policies define payment rules. Budgets define session limits. Each payment is explicitly authorized and verifiable."

---

## Scene 4 — Visual Demo (Autonomous Parking)
Visual sequence:
1. Autonomous vehicle enters parking garage
2. PolicyGrant appears
3. BudgetAuthorization appears
4. PaymentAuthorization triggers
5. Settlement confirmation

Narration:
"A vehicle receives a policy defining where and how it can pay."

"A session budget allows spending within defined limits."

"Each payment request is cryptographically authorized."

"The final settlement records the completed transaction."

---

## Scene 5 — Ledger Anchor
Visual:
Intent hash flowing into a public ledger.

Narration:
"An optional intent hash can be anchored to a public ledger for audit and dispute resolution."

---

## Scene 6 — Dispute Verification
Visual:
Verification chain replay.

Narration:
"Any dispute can be independently verified using the MPCP authorization chain."

---

## Closing Frame
Comparison:

MCP → tools
A2A → agents
ACP → messaging
MPCP → payments

Narration:
"MPCP is the missing layer for verifiable machine payments."
