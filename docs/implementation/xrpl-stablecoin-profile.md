# XRPL Stablecoin Profile (PR21)

MPCP reference profile for **XRPL issued assets** (IOUs / stablecoins). Makes MPCP concrete for real XRPL-based machine payments.

## Overview

This profile defines how MPCP artifacts are used with XRPL issued currencies such as RLUSD or other stablecoins. It specifies payment constraints, wallet expectations, and verifier requirements for stablecoin settlement on XRPL.

## Asset Constraints

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| `kind` | `IOU` (XRPL issued asset) |
| `currency` | 3-character code (e.g. `RLUSD`, `USD`) |
| `issuer` | XRPL account address (e.g. `rIssuer`) |

**Decimals:** XRPL IOUs typically use 6 decimal places. Amounts in MPCP are expressed in the asset's smallest unit (e.g. `19440000` = 19.44 RLUSD).

**Issuer validation:** Wallets and verifiers MUST validate that the issuer in MPCP artifacts matches the trusted issuer for the currency. Do not accept arbitrary issuers.

## Policy Shape

Policies using this profile must include:

- `allowedRails`: `["xrpl"]`
- `allowedAssets`: Array of `{ kind: "IOU", currency: string, issuer: string }`
- `destinationAllowlist` (in SBA): XRPL account addresses allowed as payment destinations
- `maxAmountMinor`, `expiresAt` per standard MPCP

## Wallet Expectations

A machine wallet implementing this profile MUST:

1. **Validate issuer** — Only sign SPAs for assets whose issuer is in the trusted set
2. **Respect destination allowlist** — SPA destination must be in the SBA's `destinationAllowlist`
3. **Amount precision** — Use 6 decimals for RLUSD-style assets; amounts are in smallest units
4. **Settlement intent** — Produce a SettlementIntent with `rail: "xrpl"`, `asset`, `amount`, `destination` before signing SPA

## Verifier Expectations

A verifier (e.g. parking meter, charging station) MUST:

1. **Verify the chain** — PolicyGrant → SBA → SPA → SettlementIntent → Settlement
2. **Check asset consistency** — Same `currency` and `issuer` across all artifacts
3. **Validate destination** — Settlement destination matches SPA and is in SBA allowlist
4. **Validate amount** — Settlement amount ≤ SPA amount ≤ SBA maxAmountMinor
5. **Check issuer** — Issuer is in the verifier's trusted issuer list for that currency

## Verification Guidance

Use `mpcp verify` on any artifact bundle:

```bash
mpcp verify examples/xrpl-stablecoin/xrpl-stablecoin-bundle.json
mpcp verify examples/xrpl-stablecoin/xrpl-stablecoin-bundle.json --explain
```

For policy validation:

```bash
mpcp policy-summary profiles/xrpl-stablecoin.json --profile xrpl-stablecoin
```

**Verification checklist:**

- [ ] All artifacts present (policyGrant, sba, spa, settlementIntent, settlement)
- [ ] Signatures valid for SBA and SPA
- [ ] Intent hash in SPA matches canonical hash of SettlementIntent
- [ ] Asset (currency, issuer) consistent across chain
- [ ] Destination in SBA allowlist
- [ ] Amounts non-increasing: settlement ≤ SPA ≤ SBA max

## Example Bundle

See `examples/xrpl-stablecoin/xrpl-stablecoin-bundle.json` for a complete, verifiable bundle conforming to this profile.

## Future: Multi-Issuer

This profile currently assumes a single trusted issuer per currency. Future versions may support multiple issuers (e.g. different RLUSD issuers) with explicit allowlists.
