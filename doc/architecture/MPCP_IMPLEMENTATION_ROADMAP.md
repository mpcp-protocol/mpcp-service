# MPCP Implementation Roadmap

This document defines the implementation plan for the **Machine Payment Control Protocol (MPCP)** reference implementation.

The goal of this roadmap is to evolve MPCP from a **specification and prototype** into a **deterministic, verifiable, production‑ready protocol stack**.

The roadmap is divided into phases. Each phase is intended to be implemented through **small focused PRs** to keep review scope manageable.

---

# Guiding Principles

The implementation roadmap follows several principles:

**Protocol first**  
The protocol specification remains the source of truth. Code must conform to the protocol definitions.

**Determinism**  
All MPCP artifacts must serialize and hash deterministically across implementations.

**Rail agnostic**  
MPCP must remain independent of any specific payment rail.

**Verifiable**  
Every payment decision and settlement must be independently verifiable.

**Small PRs**  
Each feature is implemented in isolated PRs to ensure safe review and easy rollback.

---

# Phase 1 — Protocol Determinism

Goal: Ensure MPCP artifacts produce **deterministic hashes and serialization**.

This phase establishes the foundation required for:

- SettlementIntentHash
- cross‑implementation verification
- distributed anchoring

---

## PR 1 — Canonical Serialization

Create a deterministic JSON canonicalization implementation.

Directory:

src/canonical/

Files:

- canonicalJson.ts
- hash.ts

Responsibilities:

- stable key ordering
- UTF‑8 encoding
- whitespace removal
- deterministic serialization

Example flow:

SettlementIntent

→ canonical JSON

→ SHA256

→ SettlementIntentHash

Acceptance Criteria:

- identical hash across multiple runs
- identical hash across Node versions
- deterministic ordering verified in tests

Tests:

- canonical serialization snapshot tests
- hash stability tests

---

## PR 2 — Artifact Schemas

Define strict schemas for all MPCP artifacts.

Directory:

src/schema/

Schemas:

- PolicyGrant
- BudgetAuthorization
- SignedBudgetAuthorization
- SignedPaymentAuthorization
- SettlementIntent
- FleetPolicyAuthorization

Recommended tooling:

- zod

Responsibilities:

- validate artifact structure
- enforce required fields
- prevent malformed artifacts

Acceptance Criteria:

- all artifacts validate through schema
- invalid artifacts rejected with clear errors

---

## PR 3 — SettlementIntentHash Implementation

Implement deterministic hashing of settlement intents.

Directory:

src/hash/

Functions:

computeSettlementIntentHash(intent)

Responsibilities:

- canonicalize intent
- compute SHA256
- produce deterministic intentHash

Acceptance Criteria:

- identical hash across identical intents
- mismatch detected if any field changes

Tests:

- intent mutation tests
- hash equality tests

---

# Phase 2 — Verification Engine

Goal: Implement a complete **MPCP verification engine**.

The verifier confirms that a settlement is valid according to all prior protocol artifacts.

---

## PR 4 — Core Verifier

Directory:

src/verify/

Functions:

- verifyPolicyGrant()
- verifyBudgetAuthorization()
- verifyPaymentAuthorization()
- verifySettlementIntent()
- verifySettlement()

Responsibilities:

Verify that:

- artifacts form a valid chain
- spending limits are respected
- policies are satisfied

Acceptance Criteria:

- settlement verification returns deterministic result
- clear failure reasons provided

---

## PR 5 — MPCP Verifier CLI

Create a command line verifier tool.

Directory:

src/cli/

Example usage:

npx mpcp verify settlement.json

Output example:

✔ intent hash valid

✔ SPA signature valid

✔ budget within limits

✔ policy grant valid

MPCP verification PASSED

Purpose:

- debugging
- dispute resolution
- protocol compliance checks

### PR 5A — CLI Explain Mode

Enhance the MPCP verifier CLI with an **explain mode** that provides step‑by‑step diagnostics for verification results.

Example usage:

npx mpcp verify settlement.json --explain

Example output:

MPCP Verification Report

✔ PolicyGrant.schema
✔ SignedBudgetAuthorization.schema
✔ SignedPaymentAuthorization.schema
✔ SettlementIntent.schema
✔ SignedBudgetAuthorization.valid
✘ SettlementIntent.intentHash mismatch
  Expected: 5d9b3c...
  Actual:   a1c82f...

Verification FAILED

Purpose:

- provide detailed debugging information
- help fleet operators diagnose payment failures
- support dispute investigation and audit workflows

Implementation:

Add a detailed verification report structure:

```
type VerificationCheck = {
  name: string           // Artifact.check (e.g. SettlementIntent.intentHash)
  phase: "schema" | "linkage" | "hash" | "policy"  // ordering: schema → linkage → hash → policy
  valid: boolean
  reason?: string
  expected?: unknown
  actual?: unknown
}

type DetailedVerificationReport = {
  valid: boolean
  checks: VerificationCheck[]  // sorted by phase
}
```

Verification check ordering: schema → linkage → hash → policy

Verification check naming: Artifact.check (e.g. PolicyGrant.schema, SignedBudgetAuthorization.schema, SettlementIntent.intentHash)

JSON output (`--json`): `{ "valid": boolean, "checks": VerificationCheck[] }`

Add a new verifier function: verifySettlementDetailed()

The CLI should render human‑readable output when `--explain` is used and machine‑readable JSON when `--json` is used.

Acceptance Criteria:

- CLI supports `--explain` flag
- CLI supports `--json` flag
- verification output clearly identifies the failing artifact
- verification checks are deterministically ordered by phase
- JSON output conforms to DetailedVerificationReport structure

---

---

# Phase 3 — Developer Adoption

Goal: Make MPCP easy to integrate.

---

## PR 7 — SDK Improvements

- artifact construction
- artifact signing
- verification helpers

Directory:

src/sdk/

Add helpers:

createPolicyGrant()

createBudgetAuthorization()

### PR 8A — Autonomous Spend Guardrails Demo

Introduce a reference demonstration that highlights MPCP's core capability for **Machine Wallet Guardrails** — the ability for autonomous systems to spend money safely within cryptographically enforced limits.

Background:

Autonomous machines (robotaxis, delivery robots, charging systems, parking meters) must often perform payments without human approval. The primary risk for fleet operators is **unbounded or fraudulent machine spending**.

MPCP addresses this by enforcing a chain of authorization artifacts:

FleetPolicy → PolicyGrant → BudgetAuthorization → SignedPaymentAuthorization → Settlement

Each step progressively constrains the machine's spending ability through:

- maximum spend limits
- allowed payment rails
- allowed assets
- destination allowlists
- expiration times
- cryptographic signatures

This forms a **machine‑enforced spending sandbox**.

Example scenario:

A robotaxi performs autonomous payments during a trip:

vehicle arrives at parking

→ parking meter issues payment request

→ vehicle evaluates policy constraints

→ vehicle signs SPA within its authorized budget

→ parking meter verifies MPCP artifact chain

→ gate opens

No centralized payment API is required.

Demo Architecture:

Reference components may include:

- autonomous vehicle agent (wallet + MPCP SDK)
- parking / charging / toll service endpoint
- MPCP verifier
- settlement rail (XRPL, Stripe, etc.)

The demo should illustrate:

- policy‑limited autonomous spending
- local verification of MPCP artifacts
- tamper‑resistant authorization chains

Purpose:

### PR 8B — Automated Fleet Payment Demo

Create a runnable demonstration showing how an autonomous fleet vehicle performs a real MPCP‑controlled payment during operation.

Goal:

Demonstrate the complete **machine‑to‑machine payment loop** using MPCP artifacts and local verification.

Example Flow:

Robotaxi enters a parking facility

→ parking meter or gate sends payment request

→ vehicle evaluates its fleet policy and session budget

→ vehicle generates SettlementIntent

→ vehicle signs SignedPaymentAuthorization (SPA)

→ payment is executed on the configured settlement rail

→ parking system verifies MPCP artifact chain

→ gate opens

Components:

The demo should include minimal reference services:

- **Vehicle Agent**
  - MPCP SDK
  - wallet / signing keys
  - policy + budget enforcement

- **Parking / Charging Service**
  - payment request endpoint
  - MPCP verification endpoint

- **Verifier**
  - validates PolicyGrant → SBA → SPA → SettlementIntent chain

- **Settlement Rail Adapter**
  - mock rail or XRPL reference implementation

Key Behaviors to Demonstrate:

- autonomous payment authorization within fleet limits
- enforcement of session budgets
- deterministic SettlementIntent hashing
- verification without centralized payment infrastructure
- tamper detection if artifacts are modified

Deliverables:

- runnable demo script
- architecture diagram
- example MPCP artifact bundle
- documentation describing the end‑to‑end flow

Purpose:

Provide a **clear real‑world demonstration** of MPCP enabling autonomous machine payments for fleet systems such as robotaxis, delivery robots, charging infrastructure, and logistics automation.

This demo will serve as the primary reference for developers, partners, and mobility companies evaluating MPCP.

→ budget authorization

→ SPA

→ settlement intent

→ settlement verification

Acceptance Criteria:

- full lifecycle passes verification

---

# Phase 4 — Protocol Network Effects

Goal: Enable MPCP to operate in **multi‑party environments**.

---

## PR 10 — Intent Anchoring

Add optional support for publishing intent hashes to distributed ledgers.

Possible rails:

- Hedera HCS
- XRPL
- EVM

Purpose:

Provide:

- public auditability
- dispute protection
- replay protection

---

## PR 11 — Dispute Verification

Add tooling to verify disputed settlements.

Functions:

Inputs:

- settlement
- artifacts
- ledger anchor

Output:

verified / invalid

---

## PR 12 — Fleet Operator Tooling

- payment audit trails
- settlement verification logs

---

# Expected Outcome

After completion of this roadmap MPCP will provide:

- a formal protocol specification
- deterministic artifact hashing
- a reference verifier
- an SDK
- integration examples

This enables MPCP to serve as a **machine‑to‑machine payment control protocol** for autonomous systems.

---

# Long Term Vision

MPCP aims to become a **standard protocol for autonomous machine payments** including:

- autonomous vehicles
- delivery robots
- machine marketplaces
- energy infrastructure

The reference implementation in this repository serves as the foundation for that ecosystem.
