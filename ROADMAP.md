# mpcp-reference — Implementation Roadmap

TypeScript reference implementation and canonical protocol SDK for the [Machine Payment Control Protocol (MPCP)](https://mpcp-protocol.github.io/spec/).

Implements: protocol verification engine, artifact schemas, cryptographic signing, on-chain anchoring adapters, golden test vectors, and the full SDK consumed by `mpcp-policy-authority`, `mpcp-wallet-sdk`, and `mpcp-merchant-sdk`.

**Stack:** Node.js 22 + TypeScript (ESM), Vitest, Zod.

---

## Guiding Principles

**Protocol first** — the specification is the source of truth; code conforms to it, not the other way around.

**Determinism** — all artifacts serialize and hash identically across implementations and runtimes.

**Rail agnostic** — no dependency on a specific payment rail or ledger.

**Verifiable** — every payment decision and settlement can be independently verified without contacting a central service.

**Small PRs** — each feature lands in an isolated PR for safe review and easy rollback.

## Phase 6 — Adoption Acceleration

| PR | Title | Status |

| PR27 | On-Chain Policy Anchoring (`anchorRef`, `resolveXrplDid`, `hederaHcsAnchorPolicyDocument`, `checkXrplNftRevocation`) | ✓ |
| PR28 | Encrypted Policy Anchoring (`submitMode`, AES-256-GCM via `crypto.subtle`, `PolicyDocumentCustody`, XRPL IPFS prep) | ✓ |

---

## PR21 — Payment Profiles Expansion

Expand reference profiles so MPCP is immediately usable for real payment ecosystems.

Initial focus:
- XRPL Stablecoin Profile — RLUSD / issued-asset payment constraints
- Wallet and verifier expectations for stablecoin settlement

Future candidates: Stellar, Hedera, EVM stablecoin.

Deliverables:
- Profile document(s)
- Example artifact bundles
- Verification guidance per profile

---

## PR22 — Layer-1 Ecosystem Evaluation

Research and document which L1/payment ecosystem to prioritize next for MPCP deployment profiles.

Evaluation criteria: stablecoin support, settlement finality, fees, compliance features, offline/verifier friendliness, developer tooling.

Deliverables:
- Research document comparing candidates
- Recommended next profile target with rationale

---

## PR23 — Machine Wallet Guardrails

Document and demonstrate how MPCP acts as a machine wallet guardrail layer: a machine wallet may not send funds unless the payment satisfies the full PolicyGrant → SBA → SPA constraint chain.

Deliverables:
- Guide describing the guardrail model
- Wallet integration example
- Threat-model notes for overspend and misuse prevention

---

## PR24 — Automated Fleet Payment Demo

Visual end-to-end demonstration of an MPCP-controlled fleet payment (vehicle → parking/charging facility → verifier → settlement).

Deliverables:
- Runnable demo script
- Architecture diagram
- Companion documentation

---

## PR25 — MPCP Conformance Badge

Lightweight conformance process: implementations that pass the golden vectors and required verification checks may claim compatibility.

Deliverables:
- Conformance criteria
- Badge / claim format
- Documentation for external implementers

---

## Deferred

- **Multi-SBA batching** — verify multiple SBAs in a single call (bulk settlement)
- **Streaming payment verification** — incremental spend verification for micropayment streams
- **Push revocation** — WebSocket listener for real-time revocation events
- **EVM stablecoin anchor adapter** — extend intent anchoring to EVM chains
